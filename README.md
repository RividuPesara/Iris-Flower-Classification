# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement

The iris flower is a distinctive genus of flowering plants. There are three primary species: *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*. These species exhibit variations in their measurements in sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Objective

To develop machine learning models capable of learning from the measurements of iris flowers and accurately classifying them into their species.

## Project Details

- **Iris Species:** The dataset contains 3 species *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*.
- **Key Measurements:** The essential characteristics used for classification include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- **Machine Learning Models:** The project involves training Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to classify iris flowers based on their measurements.

## Results

Logistic Regression model was tuned with different regularization parameters, and the best cross validated accuracy was  with:  
    C = 2.0 : Accuracy = 95.53%

- **Manual Rule-based Classifier Accuracy:** 96.43%  
- **Final Logistic Regression Model (C=2) Test Accuracy:** 97.37%
